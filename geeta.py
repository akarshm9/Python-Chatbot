            is with one-another. If you have seen that you are alone it means you knew an important fact about the world, so it is 
            a good feeling because if someone will cheat on you or use you then you can ignore him and just think that 
            you are alone so what to feel bad about the person. Because other people after getting a betrayal from other person
            got disappointed and then maybe depressed.And it will give you a lesson that don't trust on others. If you are alone then
            without trusting everyone you start your work lonely, because you have a huge amount of time to do a good and great work.
